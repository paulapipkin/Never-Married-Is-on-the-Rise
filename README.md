# Never Married Is on the Rise
Data Visualization Exercise - Data from dataworld - Never Married Is on the Rise
For this dataset I have created 3 different exploratory vizualizations:  
#1 - data grouped by gender, a line plot including all age groups showing how the 'Never Married"rate increase between 2006 and 2016.  
#2 - data gouped by gender, a catplot using grouped bars per age group and split in 2006/2016  
#3 - data group by age group, subplot per group and again using grouped bars to separate gender and show the diferrence between 2006/2016
